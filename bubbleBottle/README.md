# How I made it

I created a class of bubble with attributes: (x,y) location, radius and speedY. Bubble with bigger radius will have smaller speedY, which means it moves slower. There is also move() to slightly change **x** so that the bubble vibrates horizontally. 

In the main class, I used an array of 250 bubbles. Then I used loop to display and move the bubble.
